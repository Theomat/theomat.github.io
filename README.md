## About me

Since October 2021, I am a PhD student at [LaBRI][LABRI], Université de Bordeaux, under the supervision of [Laurent Simon](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/) and [Nathanaël Fijalkow](https://nathanael-fijalkow.github.io/).
I graduated from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][ENSEIRB] in September 2021 majoring in AI.
