This is a compilation of random things that I think are cool.
Views are my own.

## Research related

- Research for Science should be open-access.

- if I have a powerful program synthesis algorithm, I'd ask it to generate a program synthesis algorithm and see if it finds itself.

## Random thoughts

## Random things about me

I really like <i class="fas fa-globe" style="color:#3498db;"></i> geopolitics, I have a soft spot for romance stories <i class="fas fa-book"></i>.
I love playing games <i class="fas fa-dice"></i>, I almost never refuse playing.
I follow the F1 championship, which should not be encouraged because of the <i class="fas fa-leaf" style="color:#2ecc71;"></i> environment.

Did you know? I'm French yet I don't drink alcohol, I don't eat cheese nor bread...

I deeply relate with pandas based on some of their difficulties. You can try to take a guess and ask me about it. :)
