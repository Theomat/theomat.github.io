## Research related

- Research for Science should be open-access.
- Do you know [knowledge clustering](https://github.com/remimorvan/Knowledge-Clustering) perhaps it will change the way you write papers?
- [Slow science](http://slow-science.org/)
- If I have a powerful program synthesis algorithm, I'd ask it to generate a program synthesis algorithm and see if it finds itself. Can it find a strictly better algorithm with respect to time but with the same power?
- What if we could thumbs up and thumbs down paper on ArXiv? Would good papers be rewarded or only marketable papers?
- Is the following decision problem NP-hard? Is it NP-complete?
  given a forest of trees on an alphabet, find a tree t s.t. t is the argmax of the sum of size of trees in the forest with every instance of t replaced with the letter X (not in the alphabet)
  Informally, this is "library learning" in program synthesis, the forest is a dataset of programs and you are trying to learn a new letter (=a primitive for your DSL) for your alphabet to better express the programs.

## Random things about me

My [ha-index](https://www.irif.fr/~haberm/haindex.html) is 80 or 81, I believe it is at least as meaningful as the h-index.

I really like <i class="fas fa-globe" style="color:#3498db;"></i> geopolitics, I have a soft spot for romance stories <i class="fas fa-book"></i>.
I love playing games <i class="fas fa-dice"></i>, I almost never refuse playing.

Did you know? I'm French yet I don't drink alcohol, I don't eat cheese nor bread...
