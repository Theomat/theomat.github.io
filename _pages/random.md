## Research related

- Research for Science should be open-access. Notice that this is a statement which means it is not up for debate.
- [Slow science](http://slow-science.org/)
- If I have a powerful program synthesis algorithm, I'd ask it to generate a program synthesis algorithm and see if it finds itself. Can it find a strictly better algorithm with respect to time but with the same power?
- What if we changed the reviewing system to be less random?

## Random thoughts

- *What if by taking a picture of the sky and giving my location, some algorithm could tell me the rain quantity and time very locally?*

  > Let's say I go out in the center of Bordeaux for a total of 2 hours, I could know if I need to take an umbrella just for those 2 hours. 

- What is the opposite of white-snow? black-soot? If you have something better, please tell me.

## Random things about me

My [ha-index](https://www.irif.fr/~haberm/haindex.html) is 80 or 81.

I really like <i class="fas fa-globe" style="color:#3498db;"></i> geopolitics, I have a soft spot for romance stories <i class="fas fa-book"></i>.
I love playing games <i class="fas fa-dice"></i>, I almost never refuse playing.
I follow the F1 championship, which should not be encouraged because of the <i class="fas fa-leaf" style="color:#2ecc71;"></i> environment.

Did you know? I'm French yet I don't drink alcohol, I don't eat cheese nor bread...

I deeply relate with pandas based on some of their difficulties. You can try to take a guess and ask me about it. :)
