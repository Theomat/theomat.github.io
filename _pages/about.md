Starting in January 2025, I am a postdoc in the [DiverSE][DIVERSE] team in Rennes.
I defended my PhD thesis entitled "Scaling Domain Agnostic Techniques for Program Synthesis" on 10/12/2024, I was supervised by [Nathanaël Fijalkow][NATH] in [LaBRI][LABRI]. You can find my [slides](./files/slides_thesis.pdf) and my [manuscript](./files/thesis.pdf).

You can send me an email at `theomatricon@gmail.com` or `theo.matricon@inria.fr`.

**Feel free to send me a mail just to chat about some interesting work, not necessarily yours!**

## Research Interests

My research so far lie in the domains of artificial intelligence, formal methods and software engineering.
My profile lies at the intersection of these domains with the fascinating field of program synthesis.
Here is a non exhaustive [list of things I am excited about](./looking)

- **Program Synthesis**, *Code Generation*
- Performance Variability
- Machine Learning tools that can help reduce environmental impact

Honestly everything's interesting there's just not enough time but I would like to emphasize that I am more interested in research that stands the test of time (for time = some years not a few months).
