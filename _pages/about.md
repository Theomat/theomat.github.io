Since October 2021, I am a PhD student at [LaBRI][LABRI], Université de Bordeaux, under the supervision of [Nathanaël Fijalkow][NATH] and was also under the supervision of [Laurent Simon](https://www.labri.fr/perso/lsimon/) until April 2022.
I graduated from [ENSEIRB-MATMECA][ENSEIRB] in September 2021 with a major in AI.
Mentor of [Clara Marcille](https://www.labri.fr/perso/pmarcille/).

You can send me an email at `theomatricon@gmail.com`.

**Feel free to send me a mail just to chat about some interesting work, not necessarily yours!**

## Research Interests

- **Program Synthesis**, *Code Generation*
- Improving the software development pipeline
- Comparative performance of algorithm performances or managing performance variability
- Reinforcement Learning
- Machine Learning tools that can help reduce environmental impact

Honestly everything's interesting there's just not enough time but I would like to emphasize that I am more interested in research that stands the test of time (for time = some years not a few months).
