Things I am excited about
=

This is an unorganized list of things I am excited about, for some I have plenty of ideas for others I don't:

- I would like to successfully combine LLMs with formal approaches
- I want to adapt enumerative approaches for ILP and SMT solvers, there seems to be huge gains to make
- I want to make ranked enumeration on the GPU works blazingly fast (this is ongoing work with Olivier Henry my intern)
- I want to take a look at super optimisation of PTX (GPU assembly) or assembly
- I would really like to look at automatic debloating of software
- I would like to try and make an agentic framework reason about competitive video games to figure out things automatically in a scientific based way
- Minimising variability
- Automated theorem prover
- Parallelising program synthesis
- Using diffusion like approaches for code generation (this has been more or less achieved)
- Use property testing to prune the search space of code generation
- I have plenty of ideas and not enough time to develop and experiment with them so can we make an agent that helps speeding up this process?
- Given a codebase and a CI/CD pipeline, now a new commit is pushed can you select only the necessary tests to run? And maintain it across time? (this is apparently a solved problem even at scale for Google)
- Let's learn policies via reinforcement learning in the form of programs, current approaches do not scale at all

I would also like to try working in a larger team with ambitious goals a bit like what DeepMind did for AlphaGo which made progress in fundamental research.
